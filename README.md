# Chrome-Extension-for-storing-webside-url
I have developed a practical Chrome extension that allows me to save the current URL while browsing the internet. With this extension, I can easily save URLs and also have the option to edit them if needed. This flexibility enables me to customize and annotate the saved content with relevant information or notes, making it more organized and easy to manage. Moreover, I have added a useful feature that lets me save additional information alongside the URL, such as tags, categories, or descriptions. This extra functionality helps me keep track of the context and purpose of each saved link, making it effortless to find specific items later. I am proud of my extension as it showcases my web development skills and provides a valuable tool to improve my productivity and web content organization. As I continue to refine and enhance the extension, I hope it becomes a helpful resource for other users looking to manage their web browsing efficiently.
